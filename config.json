  "description" : "Heat map showing protein tissue localisation data from Protein Atlas (antibody staining data). Data is divided into tissues with each tissue shown in itâ€™s own block, each of which is further divided into specialised cells.  Expression level is binned into not detected, low, medium and high. It is possible to toggle the display to show one or more expression bins. Note that the expression colour scale does not work when toggling between bins.",
